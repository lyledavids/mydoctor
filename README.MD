# Work In Progress

# Inspiration
What if I could schedule an appointment with medical practitioner when I want and check the waiting time before I get to practice.

# What it does
My Doctor is a chat bot which helps to book and schedule appointment with multiple medical practices. User can communicate with chat-bot in natural language to book or schedule an appointment with available multiple health-care practitioners.

# How we built it
* Built a bot using python to take input from user through Cisco spark 
* Process the user input using trained  API.ai  context 
* Based the API.ai interpretation perform action against integrated health-care practitioners management system.
* Integrated health care practices and previous user details are stored in mongodb.  
* Bot works with user in conversational mode 

Following technology used for developing this system
* Python
* api.ai
* mongodb
* heroku
* Healthcare practice management software


# Challenges we ran into
* Implement conversational chat Bot
* Processing and interpreting natural language input
* Sample data to train the system and training take longer time
* Providing better user experience and meeting user expectation
* Managing multiple users.


# Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Fully functional prototype model available

# What we learned
* Nothing

# How to use
* Install my doctor chat bot
* Start the conversion then chat bot will guide through 

# What's next for My Doctor
* Training users to use chat-bot. Majority of the users are going to have their first experience with this chat-bot
* Find correct bot platform and market the chat-bot
* May be use Jarvis or Siri to get the voice input
